# Abenteuer

## What is Abenteuer?
Abenteuer, meaning Adventure in German, is an iOS app based on existing map and street data that leads you to explore the surroundings!

## How to play?
Press "Let's go!" to let the app randomly find a spot near you and present you the 3D Street View of it. Simply walk around and look for that place, and once you arrive at the correct location, a winning message will be shown. If that's the case, Congrats! You can also keep playing by pressing "Let's go!" again!

If you cannot find the place, click the ```"I can't find it >_<"``` button so the 2D map will pop up and the destination will be pointed out to you.

## How does it work?
The app utilizes Google Map SDK for iOS application, iOS GPS and location service, and facebook / twitter authentification service.

## What comes next?
We are working on setting up social media Framework such as Facebook and Twitter so you will be able to share the cool places you find with your friends!

We will work on a point system and a timer mode for each spot generated, so you can comepete with other players on how familiar you are with your surroundings!
