# Abenteuer

## What is Abenteuer?
Abenteuer, meaning Adventure in German, is an iOS app based on existing map and street data that leads you to explore the surroundings and share your findings with your friends!

## How to play?
Press "Let's go!" to let the app randomly find a spot near you and present you the 3D Street View of it. Simply walk around and look for that place, and once you arrive at the correct location, a winning message will be shown. If that's the case, Congrats! Don't forget to share it with your friends via Facebook or Twitter! You can also keep playing by pressing "Let's go!" again!

If you cannot find the place, click the ```"I can't find it >_<"``` button so the route from your current location to the destination will pop up.

## How does it work?
The app utilizes Google Map SDK for iOS application, iOS GPS and location service, and facebook / twitter authentification service.

## What comes next?
We will work on a point system and a timer mode for each spot generated, so you can comepete with other players on how familiar you are with your surroundings!
